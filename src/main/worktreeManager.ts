 * Worktree manager (team-orchestrator feature).

 * never share a working tree, then integrates a finished branch back into the base
 * (rebase onto latest base → fast-forward merge → remove the worktree). All git
 * sequencing lives here so `scheduler.ts` only deals in high-level results.
 *
 * Integration is **serialized per project** (a promise chain) so two tasks that
 * finish together can't race each other into the base branch.
 *
 * Non-git projects (or projects with worktrees disabled) transparently fall back to
 * the shared-directory behavior, which keeps existing setups working unchanged.
